<p class='reg-p'> Topics are a way of connecting users with problems they will be able to answer by sorting problems into specific, well-defined categories.</p>
<p class='reg-p'> Topics are also used to help you identify problems that are relavent or interesting to you. Users can follow topics in order to recieve problems within specific topics in their <%= signed_in? ? link_to("feed", feed_path) : "feed" %>. You can <%= link_to "browse and search new topics", topics_path %> in the topics index page to improve your feed.</p>
<p class='reg-p'> Each problem has to have at least one topic. Clicking on the topic tag corresponding to a problem brings you to a page that shows you a description of what the topic is. You can also see all problems and proofs within that topic, the past edits made to that topic (<%= link_to "See how editing works", editing_posts_path %>), and the users who are following it.</p>
<p class='reg-p'>Not everyone can <%= link_to "create a new topic", creating_topics_path %>. A certain amount of reputation is needed before you can start creating new topics. Even if you have sufficient reputation, you should only create a new topic when you are sure that your problem covers a new topic and no one else has asked about before. As a general rule, you should avoid creating new topics if possible.</p>
<p class='reg-p'>Users with sufficient reputation can edit the topic tags of a problem if they feel a certain tag was used innapropriately or if the problem is missing a topic.</p>
